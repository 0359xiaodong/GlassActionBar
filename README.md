GlassActionBar
==================

GlassActionBar is a tiny library which implements a glass-like effect for the action bar.

This library is based on techniques outlined by Nicolas Pomepuy in [a recent blog post][1].

For reasons of backwards compatibility this library relies on ActionBarSherlock. Native action bar support is in the works.

![Example Image][2]

Try out the sample application:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelpeinado.glassactionbardemo">
  <img alt="Android app on Google Play"
       src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a>

Or browse the [source code of the sample application][3] for a complete example of use.

Including in your project
-------------------------

Just add the library to your application as a library project. And don't forget that your project must use ActionBarSherlock!

Maven support is coming soon.

Usage
-----

Using the library is really simple, just look at the source code of the [provided sample][4].
